  <h2>How do I use Google Tone?</h2>
  <p>To broadcast a URL using Google Tone:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Log into your Google account.</li>
    <li>Click on the Google Tone icon in your Chrome browser while on a
    web page that you want to broadcast.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Google Tone?</h2>
  <p>Google Tone helps computers communicate like we do – by talking to
  each other. It's a browser extension that lets Chrome use your
  computer's speakers to produce a special sound signature for other
  computers' microphones to identify as a URL.</p>

  <h2>How does Google Tone work?</h2>
  <p>Google Tone turns on your computer's microphone (while the extension is on).
  Google Tone temporarily stores a URL on Google’s servers and uses your
  computer's speakers and microphone to send it to nearby computers connected
  to the Internet. Any computer within earshot that also has the Google Tone
  extension installed and turned on can receive a Google Tone notification. The
  notification will display the URL along with your Google Profile name and
  picture.</p>

  <p>To receive a URL with Google Tone, Chrome needs to keep your microphone
  on. Google Tone may not work in loud spaces, over a distance, with a
  poor Internet connection or on computers without a microphone or with
  a microphone incapable of detecting sound broadcast by Google Tone.</p>

  <h2>How does Google Tone use my data?</h2>
  <p>Google Tone collects anonymous usage data in accordance with <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google’s
    Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>How do I turn it on and off?</h2>
    <p>To turn Google Tone (including the microphone) on and off, go to the
    Chrome extension settings.</p>

    <h2>Is it secure?</h2>
    <p>Google Tone only broadcasts URLs, so recipients do not automatically
    gain access to a page to which they wouldn't ordinarily have access. If you
    broadcast your Gmail inbox URL, for example, recipients who click on the
    Google Tone notification will be prompted to log in to their Gmail.
    However, Google Tone broadcasts are public by design, so it's best not to
    use them to exchange confidential information.</p>
