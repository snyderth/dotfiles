<p><strong>Foundations</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The foundations are not built on directly.</li>
	<li>The ten piles are both tableau and foundations, and all building is on 
	the tableau.</li>
	<li>When an entire suite of thirteen cards becomes exposed, it is 
	automatically removed from the tableau.</li>
	<li>The game is won if the entire deck in all eight suites is discarded and 
	nothing is left on the tableau.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong> (Ten columns with six cards in the first four 
columns and five cards in the remaining ones. The top card of each column is 
face up.)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Build down. For example, a 5
	<img alt="Spades Suit" height="9" src="solitaire/help/images/spades.gif" width="9"> 
	can be played on a 6
	<img alt="Spades Suit" height="9" src="solitaire/help/images/spades.gif" width="9">.</li>
	<li>The top card of each column is available for play to another tableau 
	column.</li>
	<li>Cards of the same suit and in a descending sequence may be moved as a 
	unit, in whole or in part, to another column.</li>
	<li>Nothing can be placed on an Ace. A King cannot move, except to an empty 
	space.</li>
	<li>Spaces may be filled with any available card or packed sequence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stock</strong> (Fifty cards)</p>
<ul>

	<li>There must be at least one card in each tableau columns before you can 
	deal a new row of cards.</li>
	<li>There is no redeal.</li>
</ul>
