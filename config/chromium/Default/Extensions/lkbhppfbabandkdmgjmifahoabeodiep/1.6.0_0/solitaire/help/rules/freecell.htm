<h3><img src="solitaire/help/images/rules.png" height="26" width="26"> Rules</h3>
<p><strong>Foundations</strong> (Four piles; upper right side of screen)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Build up in suit from Ace to King. For example, a 2
	<img alt="Heart Suit" height="9" src="solitaire/help/images/hearts.gif" width="9"> 
	can be played on an Ace
	<img alt="Heart Suit" height="9" src="solitaire/help/images/hearts.gif" width="9">.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cells</strong> (or Reserve: four cells, upper left)</p>
<ul>
	<li>These are the "cells". The cells are storage (holding) locations for 
	cards being played to the foundations and the tableau.</li>
	<li>Cells can hold only one card at a time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong> (Eight columns, below foundations and cells)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Build down in alternating colors. For example, a 10
	<img alt="Spades Suit" height="9" src="solitaire/help/images/spades.gif" width="9"> 
	can be played on a Jack
	<img alt="Heart Suit" height="9" src="solitaire/help/images/hearts.gif" width="9"><img alt="Diamonds Suit" height="9" src="solitaire/help/images/diamonds.gif" width="9">.</li>
	<li>The top card of each column is available for play to the foundations, to 
	another tableau column or to the cells.</li>
	<li>Move groups of cards if they are in sequence, and if there are enough 
	free cells where the cards could be moved individually.</li>
	<li>Spaces may be filled with any card or card sequence.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width:50%">
<h3><img src="solitaire/help/images/strategy.png" height="26" width="26"> Strategy</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Try to move cards from the reserve (free cells) to the tableau as soon 
	as possible.</li>
	<li>Use the reserve to temporarily hold cards that are blocking tableau 
	columns.</li>
	<li>When building on the tableau, always try to play cards to a column whose 
	top card is a King or has a very high rank.</li>
	</ul>
